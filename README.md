# Redux Toolkit with TypeScript Integration and Code Refactoring

This project represents a structured implementation of Redux Toolkit, with TypeScript added to enhance type safety and scalability. The codebase was initially developed by another contributor ( Ishtiaq Ahmad ), whose original work can be found [here](https://github.com/Isthiaq-Ahmed/Drag_And_Drop_Library_Practice).

## Enhancements & Additions:

- **TypeScript Integration**: Type safety has been introduced throughout the entire project. All slices, actions, reducers, and components have been typed to ensure reliability and prevent potential type-related errors.
  
- **Providers**: Custom providers have been created to manage state and side effects efficiently, aligning with React’s context and state management best practices.

- **Custom Hooks**: I have refactored the code by introducing reusable custom hooks. This improves code maintainability and keeps business logic separate from component logic.

- **Code Refactoring**: Following best practices, the code has been restructured to distinguish between container (stateful) and presentational (stateless) components. This separation improves clarity, testability, and scalability.

- **Best Practices**: Adhering to clean code principles, the project was refactored to follow modern React patterns, including optimal usage of Redux Toolkit’s `createSlice` and custom hooks for data fetching and state management.

## Project Status:

While the core structure is fully functional and showcases solid practices in React, TypeScript, and Redux, there is still room for improvement in areas like further optimization, additional testing, and potential UI/UX enhancements. However, this version is stable and effective as a showcase of professional frontend development skills.

## Remaining Areas:

The JSX structure and MUI components remain as initially provided. While they meet the current project’s needs, future iterations could involve further refinement or the application of more advanced techniques.

## Technologies Used:

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better tooling support.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: For UI components.
